# 👋 Hi, I'm Ragunath Nagaraj a researcher working at the intersection of **artificial intelligence, learning systems, and human–AI interaction**. My work explores how emerging technologies can support **collaboration, problem-solving, creativity, and skill development** across digital learning environments. I build and study AI-enabled tools that combine **learning analytics, generative AI, and user-centred design** to better understand how people learn, interact, and innovate with intelligent systems.

## 🔬 Research Focus

My current work spans several interconnected areas:
### **AI-Supported Learning Systems**
- Generative and explainable AI for learner feedback  
- AI-enabled support for project-based and innovation-driven learning  
- Responsible and transparent AI in educational contexts  
### **Learning Analytics & Human–AI Interaction**
- Behavioural-trace analysis for modelling learner behaviour  
- Interaction patterns in AI-supported tasks  
- UX, trust, and autonomy in learning with AI tools  
### **Digital Innovation & Enterprise Education**
- Technology-enhanced collaboration and creative problem-solving  
- AI tools that support interdisciplinary teamwork  
- Skill development for innovation and entrepreneurial learning
