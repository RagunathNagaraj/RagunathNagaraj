👋 Hi, I'm a researcher working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, learning systems, and human–AI interaction. My work explores how emerging technologies can support collaboration, problem-solving, creativity, and skill development across digital learning environments. I build and study AI-enabled tools that combine learning analytics, generative AI, and user-centred design to understand how people learn, interact, and innovate with intelligent systems.

🔬 Research Focus

AI-Supported Learning Systems:
- Generative and explainable AI for learner feedback
- AI-enabled support for project-based and innovation-driven learning
- Responsible and transparent AI in educational contexts

Learning Analytics and Human–AI Interaction:
- Behavioural-trace analysis for modelling learner behaviour
- Interaction patterns in AI-supported tasks
- UX, trust, and autonomy in learning with AI tools

Digital Innovation and Enterprise Education:
- Technology-enhanced collaboration and creative problem-solving
- AI tools that support interdisciplinary teamwork
- Skill development for innovation and entrepreneurial learning

🤝 Open to Collaboration

I collaborate on projects involving:
- AI in education
- Learning analytics
- Human–AI interaction
- Digital learning innovation
- Enterprise or entrepreneurship education
- Responsible AI and explainability
